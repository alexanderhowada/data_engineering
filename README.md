# General data engineering projects and drafts.

Under construction. This repo implements several scripts for testing concepts.

This repository is intended to be used as it is, but it may require building a Python wheel in the future.

- Airflow: ETLs with airflow. My airflow deployment points to this folder.
- Utils: general purpose utilities with tested Pytest/unittest.
- drafts: contains code used for testing and exploration.
